#welcome to AGRO HUB PROJRCT
üöÄ Overview
AgroHub is a comprehensive web platform designed to empower farmers and agricultural stakeholders by providing essential tools for crop management, market access, and knowledge sharing. Our goal is to streamline farming operations, foster community, and promote sustainable agricultural practices.
‚ú® Features
AgroHub comes packed with features to support the modern farmer:
 * Crop Management Dashboard: Track crop cycles, planting dates, and harvest predictions.
 * Marketplace Integration: Connect buyers and sellers for direct trade of agricultural products.
 * Weather Forecasting: Get real-time weather updates and agricultural advisories relevant to your location.
 * Knowledge Base: Access articles, guides, and best practices for various crops and farming techniques.
 * Community Forum: Engage with other farmers, share insights, and get advice.
 * Resource Planning: Tools to help manage water, fertilizer, and labor more efficiently.
üì¶ Installation
To get AgroHub up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
 * Git: For cloning the repository.
 * Node.js (LTS recommended): For backend services and frontend development.
 * npm (comes with Node.js): For package management.
 * MongoDB: Our primary database.
Steps
# Clone the AgroHub repository
git clone https://github.com/devfame-ug/agrohub.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd agrohub

# Install backend dependencies (assuming a Node.js backend)
cd backend # Or your specific backend folder name
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies (assuming a React/Vue/Angular frontend)
cd ../frontend # Or your specific frontend folder name
npm install

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Usage
Once installed, you can launch AgroHub:
Backend
# From the 'backend' directory
npm start

This will typically start the API server, often on http://localhost:5000 (check your backend configuration for the exact port).
Frontend
# From the 'frontend' directory
npm start

This will launch the frontend application, usually accessible at http://localhost:3000 (check your frontend configuration for the exact port).
Once both are running, open your web browser and navigate to the frontend URL to start using AgroHub.
üõ†Ô∏è Configuration
AgroHub uses environment variables for sensitive information and flexible configuration.
 * Create a .env file in both your backend and frontend directories.
 * Add the necessary environment variables. Here are common examples (adjust as per your actual implementation):
   backend/.env:
   PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/agrohub_db
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
# Add any other backend-specific variables like API keys for weather services
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_service_api_key

   frontend/.env:
   REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
# Add any other frontend-specific variables

üß™ Testing
To ensure everything is working correctly, you can run the project's tests.
# To run backend tests (from the 'backend' directory)
npm test

# To run frontend tests (from the 'frontend' directory)
npm test
