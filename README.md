📦 Installation
To get AgroHub up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
 * Git: For cloning the repository.
 * Node.js (LTS recommended): For backend services and frontend development.
 * npm (comes with Node.js): For package management.
 * MongoDB: Our primary database.
Steps
# Clone the AgroHub repository
git clone https://github.com/devfame-ug/agrohub.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd agrohub

# Install backend dependencies (assuming a Node.js backend)
cd backend # Or your specific backend folder name
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies (assuming a React/Vue/Angular frontend)
cd ../frontend # Or your specific frontend folder name
npm install

🏃‍♀️ Usage
Once installed, you can launch AgroHub:
Backend
# From the 'backend' directory
npm start

This will typically start the API server, often on http://localhost:5000 (check your backend configuration for the exact port).
Frontend
# From the 'frontend' directory
npm start

This will launch the frontend application, usually accessible at http://localhost:3000 (check your frontend configuration for the exact port).
Once both are running, open your web browser and navigate to the frontend URL to start using AgroHub.
🛠️ Configuration
AgroHub uses environment variables for sensitive information and flexible configuration.
 * Create a .env file in both your backend and frontend directories.
 * Add the necessary environment variables. Here are common examples (adjust as per your actual implementation):
   backend/.env:
   PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/agrohub_db
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
# Add any other backend-specific variables like API keys for weather services
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_service_api_key

   frontend/.env:
   REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
# Add any other frontend-specific variables

🧪 Testing
